# Web development Workflow

## Overview

This year has been an important one for me, in terms of of new skills & new tools. This git is a quick overview of the workflow I use on a daily basis. All of these work on Mac OS X, but some of them are also available for Windows & Unix systems.

## The goddamn list

#### Productivity apps

* [**Alfred**](http://www.alfredapp.com)    THE launcher app. Don't launch any app with the mouse. Never again.
* [**Sublime Text 2**](http://sublimetext.com) Does it need to be introduced ? Check [my config repo](https://github.com/ayamflow/sublime-text-config).
* [**MAMP Pro**](http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/) Easy local host setting like http://my-project.dev
* [**Divvy**](http://mizage.com/divvy/) Manage your windows with keyboard shortcut (like half screen, a third, etc).
* [**Dash**](http://kapeli.com/dash) Gather all documentations in one place.
* [**iTerm2**](http://www.iterm2.com/) Better Mac OS X Terminal, with split panels.
* [**Tower**](http://www.git-tower.com/) Git GUI (useful for history)
* [**Cyberduck**](http://cyberduck.ch) FTP client, might switch to Transmit ?

#### Misc apps
* [**Mou**](http://mouapp.com/) Lightweight Markdown editor.
* [**VMWare Fusion**](http://www.vmware.com/fr/) For FlashDevelop & Windows tests.

#### Libraries and stuff
* [**GruntJS**](http://gruntjs.com) Terminal productivity tasks such as watch, build, server...
* [**Bower**](http://bower.io) Install & update javascript libs.
* [**Yeoman**](http://yeoman.io): (includes both GruntJS & Bower) enable fast scaffolding of webapps (with & without JS Frameworks)
* [**SASS**](http://http://sass-lang.com/) (+ [**Compass**](http://compass-style.org/) or [**Bourbon**](http://bourbon.io)) Write CSS like a real developper.
